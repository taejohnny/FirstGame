# FirstGame

Developed using Java programming language and Eclipse IDE

Purpose:
        This was my first attempt at creating a game using some GUI graphics and swing. The program features a cat that is controlled by 
     the user and the arrow keys. The cat needs to collect a coin that is randomly generated on a (x,y) coordinate on the screen, which is
     worth 10 points. Once the coin is collected 10 times, the game is over and the player can choose to play again or exit the screen. 
     Although the game sounds very simple, some of the hardest aspects to implement were the collisions of the objects, specifically between
     the cat and the coin. Even now, when the cat passes the lower part of the coin only, the coin fails to spawn in another location and 
     the score does not increment. Besides this, everything was a learning process, from figuring out how to make the pictures on screen
     to appear and for the sound to play when the game is started.
